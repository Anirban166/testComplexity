## Abstract
Being a wrapper to a C++ implementation of the functional pruning optimal partioning (fpop) algorithm, the fpop package provides the function `Fpop` which is a dynamic programming algorithm for the fast segmentation of univariate signals into piecewise constant profiles. It exactly minimizes the mean squared error for a penalty linear in the number of changepoints, which solves the problem of detecting changepoints in an univariate sequence. (by minimising the mean squared error over segmentations)
