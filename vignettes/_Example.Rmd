This vignette is written to give the user a general introduction to the features and functionality of the package, via a set of textual illustrations and one example.

## Brief Overview

As can be guessed from the name itself, this package provides a suite of functions to test the asymptotic complexities of R functions/algorithms, where the term "complexity" here refers to the *time* complexity, as per the initial idea. (and hence a relevant logo with the stopwatch was designed early on!) 

### Features

Going by the base objectives stated [here](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2020/wiki/Asymptotic-complexity-testing#details-of-your-coding-project), this package provides:

- A function for quantifying the empirical time complexity of any R expression. 
- A time complexity classifying function which operates on the result (a data frame) of the previous function.
- Testing functions, to test for an expected time complexity class directly.

In addition to these, a few more features have been implemented:
- Memory variants for the time quantifier and complexity classifier.
- Plotting functions for both time and memory cases.
- A complexity classifier for a generalized use in asymptotic trend classification among any two parameters, not being restricted to time/memory cases.
