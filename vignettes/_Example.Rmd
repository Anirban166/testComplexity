This vignette is written to give the user a general introduction to the features and functionality of the package, via a set of textual illustrations and one example.

## Brief Overview

As can be guessed from the name itself, this package provides a suite of functions to test the asymptotic complexities of R functions/algorithms, where the term "complexity" here refers to the *time* complexity, as per the initial idea. (and hence a relevant logo with the stopwatch was designed early on!)
