## Abstract
PeakSeg is a constrained maximum Poisson likelihood segmentation model, more information on which can be found [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3045118.3045154).
The package PeakSegDP provides the baseline that computes an approximate solution (subject to a constraint on the number of segments) to the up-down (changes must alternate following an up-down trend) constrained problem which satisfies the PeakSeg constraints via the constrained dynamic programming algorithm (cDPA).
