## Abstract
Changepoint detection is a central problem in time series and genomic data. For some applications, it is natural to impose constraints on the directions of changes. One example is ChIP-seq data, for which adding an up-down constraint improves peak detection accuracy, but makes the optimization problem more complicated. 

In response to this, a new algorithm which can solve problems with arbitrary affine constraints on adjacent segment means was created, which shows that a functional pruning technique can be adapted to solve such constrained changepoint detection problems.

Going by the name of `PeakSegPDPA`, this algorithm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in a benchmark of several genomic data sets, and is orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms that have similar accuracy.

## History
`PeakSegOptimal` was previously named as `coseg`, (as can be found in research papers and articles referring the same) but due to the existence of the `CoSeg` package (which is completely unrelated to the functionality of `PeakSegOptimal`) it was renamed, in order to avoid confusion.

## Time Complexity
The empirical time complexity is log-linear in the amount of data, as observed.

## Reference
The above information was extracted from the [github repository](https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegOptimal).
