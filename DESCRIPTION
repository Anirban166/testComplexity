Description: It classifies the asymptotic time plus memory complexity class/trend (such as linear/log-linear/quadratic) 
             for an algorithm-based function passed to it with the help of functions asymptoticTimeComplexityClass and
             asymptoticMemoryComplexityClass, with data frames returned by asymptoticTimings and asymptoticMemoryUsage
             as parameters. The data frames can be passed onto plotTimings and plotMemoryUsage for obtaining a visual
             description of the benchmarked results and thereby identify potential speed gains. For testing out the
             expected complexity of an algorithm, it is suggested to use the expect functions.
