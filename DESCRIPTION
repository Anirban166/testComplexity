Description: It classifies the asymptotic time complexity bound/trend (such as linear,quadratic,cubic) 
             for an algorithm-based function passed to it. Currently it holds one function by the name
             of 'loglinearvsquadraticClassifier' which distinguishes which of the two functions passed 
             as parameters to it follows a log-linear/quadratic complexity trend as can be predicted by
             its name. Note: The functions/algorithms passed to it must have the following parameters:
             (count.vec, weight.vec=rep(1,length(count.vec)), max.segments). (Eg: as in PeakSegPDPA).
