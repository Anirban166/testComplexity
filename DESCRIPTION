Description: It classifies the asymptotic time/memory complexity class for an 
             algorithm/function passed to it with the help of functions 
             asymptoticTimeComplexityClass and asymptoticMemoryComplexityClass, 
             with data frames returned by asymptoticTimings and asymptoticMemoryUsage.
             The data frames can be passed onto plotTimings and plotMemoryUsage 
             for obtaining a visual description of the benchmarked results if the
             user intends to diagnose the trend via the traditional method. 
             For testing the algorithm against an expected time complexity class, 
             the user can directly use the expect functions. Please check
