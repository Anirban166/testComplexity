Description: It classifies the asymptotic time plus memory complexity class/trend (such as linear/log-linear/quadratic) 
             for an algorithm-based function passed to it with the help of functions asymptoticTimeComplexityClass and
             asymptoticMemoryComplexityClass, with data frames returned by asymptoticTimings and asymptoticMemoryUsage
             as parameters. Further, the data frames can be passed onto plotTimings and plotMemoryUsage for visually
             obtaining the results and identifying potential speed gains.
