# testComplexity 0.1.1

* Quantifying memory allocations (and subsequently obtaining the memory complexity class) is made unavailable for systems without memory profiling functionality since this is required in order to use `bench::bench_memory()`, which is internally called via `testComplexity::asymptoticMemoryUsage()`.

# testComplexity 0.1.0

* Please check the [General Vignette](https://anirban166.github.io/testComplexity/articles/testComplexity.html) for an introduction to the functionality offered by this version of testComplexity.
