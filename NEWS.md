# testComplexity 0.1.0

* Notes:
  * Please check the [General Vignette](https://anirban166.github.io/testComplexity/articles/testComplexity.html) for an introduction to the functionality offered by this version of testComplexity.
  * Memory profiling is unavailable on Linux-x86_64-fedora (Clang/GCC) and Solaris-x86 platforms, due to which quantifying memory allocations and subsequently classifying the memory complexity class on these platforms will be made unavailable soon.
  * Feel free to add themes to the ggplot objects returned by calls to the plotters. A future version will add support for a custom dark theme.
