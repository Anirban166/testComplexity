\title{Quadratic Time Complexity Test function}
\usage{
expect_quadratic_time(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Parameters for the expression to be tested, which is a function of data.sizes, as in asymptoticTimings}
}
\value{
null for expected complexity (quadratic), else throws error.
}
\description{
Function to test if input algorithm has quadratic time complexity
}

\examples{
\donttest{
# Avoiding for CRAN since computation time can exceeds 5 seconds in some runs:
# Testing a simple expression:
input.sizes <- 10^seq(1, 4, by = 0.5)
expect_quadratic_time(N, input.sizes)
# The above code will throw an error if the function does not follow a quadratic trend.
